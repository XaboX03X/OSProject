6. You will see the [README file](./README.md) file. One is a preview of how it looks like on the web, and the other is the editing view in markdown language. 
7. Edit the [README file](./README.md). Make sure you have your group details correct, ie, group name, section and team members along with their matric IDs. 
8. Once you have finish editing, click File->Save or ***ctrl-s*** to save it. 
9. After saving, you will notice an M or U next to your file. You will need to commit any changes, whenever you make changes so that it is uploaded to the github repository. 

 <img src="./webpage/SourceControlUI.png" width="70%">

10. Click on the source control, hint: its on the left side panel, and it will list down the files that have been modified or updated. Click on commit. It will then ask you "Would you like to stage all your changes and commit them directly?" Just say yes, and a new tab will appear. Type a message to log what you have done, and click on the check mark. 

 <img src="./webpage/CommittingUI.png" width="70%">

## Running your own container instance.

1. At the terminal, run a linux instance. By typing the following command. 
```
docker pull debian
docker run --detach -it debian
```

2. This will run the debian container. To check if the debian container is running, type
```bash
@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
f65be1987f84   debian    "bash"    4 minutes ago   Up 4 minutes             romantic_jackson
```

3. Keep note of the name used by your container, this is usually given random names unless you specify your own name. Now run a bash command on the container. Make sure you use the name of your container instead of the one shown here. 
```bash
docker exec -i -t romantic_jackson /bin/bash
```

<img src="./webpage/container123.jpg" width=70%>

4. Create a file on the container. First you must make sure you are in the bash command prompt of the container. The container is new, and does not have any software other than the debian OS. To create a new file, you will need an editor installed. In the bash shell of the container, run the package manager apt-get to install nano text editor. 

```bash
root@f65be1987f84:~# apt-get update      

root@f65be1987f84:~# apt-get install nano

root@f65be1987f84:~# cd /root

root@f65be1987f84:~# nano helloworld.txt
```

<img src="./webpage/container4.jpg" width=70%>

5. Edit your helloworld.txt, create your messsage and save by typing ctrl-X. Once saved, explore using the container to see where the file is located. Then exit the shell, by typing **exit**.

<img src="./webpage/container5.jpg" width=70%>

6. Stop the container and run **docker ps -a**, and restart the container again. Is your file in the container still available?
```bash 
@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker stop romantic_jackson

@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS                        PORTS     NAMES
f65be1987f84   debian    "bash"    19 minutes ago   Exited (137) 18 seconds ago             romantic_jackson

@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker restart romantic_jackson
```

<img src="./webpage/container6.jpg" width=70%>

7. Stop the container and delete the container. What happened to your helloworld.txt?

```bash 
@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker stop romantic_jackson

@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS                        PORTS     NAMES
f65be1987f84   debian    "bash"    19 minutes ago   Exited (137) 18 seconds ago             romantic_jackson

@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker rm romantic_jackson
```

<img src="./webpage/container7.jpg" width=70%>

***Questions:***

1. Are files in the container persistent. Why not?. ***(1 mark)*** __No, files in the container are not persistent by default. This is because containers are designed to be ephemeral, meaning they can be created and destroyed without affecting the host system. Any data stored in the container's file system will be lost when the container is removed. To persist data, you need to use Docker volumes or bind mounts, which allow data to be stored outside the container's file system and be retained even after the container is deleted.__.

2. Can we run two, or three instances of debian linux? . ***(1 mark)*** __Yes, you can run multiple instances of Debian Linux. Each instance runs in its own isolated container, and you can create and start as many instances as your system resources allow.__.

## Running your own container with persistent storage

1. In the previous experiment, you might have notice that containers are not persistent. To make storage persistent, you will need to mount them. 
At the terminal, create a new directory called **myroot**, and run a instance of debian linux and mount myroot to the container. Find out the exact path of my root, and mount it as the root folder in the debian container. 
2. Create a file in /root on the container, the files should also appear in myroot of your host VM.

```bash 
@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ mkdir myroot
@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ cd myroot/
@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject/myroot (main) $ pwd
/workspaces/OSProject/myroot

@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject/myroot (main) $ docker run --detach -it -v /workspaces/OSProject/myroot:/root debian
```

***Questions:***

1. Check the permission of the files created in myroot, what user and group is the files created in docker container on the host virtual machine? . ***(2 mark)*** __user: youthful_shirley__.
<img src="./webpage/containerp1.jpg" width=70%>

2. Can you change the permission of the files to user codespace.  You will need this to be able to commit and get points for this question. ***(2 mark)***
```bash
//use sudo and chown
sudo chown -R codespace:codespace myroot

```
<img src="./webpage/containerp2.jpg" width=70%>

## You are on your own, create your own static webpage

1. Create a directory called webpage in your host machine
2. Inside the directory, create a page index.html, with any content you would like
<img src="./webpage/staticw12.jpg" width=70%>
<img src="./webpage/staticw2.jpg" width=70%>

3. Then, run the apache webserver and mount the webpage directory to it. Hint:
```bash
## the -p 8080:80 flag points the host port 8080 to the container port 80

docker run --detach -v /workspaces/OSProject/webpage:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ -p 8080:80 httpd
```

4. If it works, codespace will trigger a port assignment and provide a URL for you to access your webpage like the one below.

 <img src="./webpage/websitelink.png" width="70%">


5. You can also see the Port in the **PORTS** tab, next to the terminal tab.

6. You can then access your website by adding an index.html towards the end of your url link, like the one below. 

 <img src="./webpage/helloworldweb.png" width="70%">

**Image of static webpage**
<img src="./webpage/staticw3456.jpg" width=70%>

***Questions:***

1. What is the permission of folder /usr/local/apache/htdocs and what user and group owns the folder? . ***(2 mark)*** __Fill answer here__.
<img src="./webpage/staticq1.jpg" width=70%>

2. What port is the apache web server running. ***(1 mark)*** __8081__.
3. What port is open for http protocol on the host machine? ***(1 mark)*** __8081:80__.
<img src="./webpage/staticq3.jpg" width=70%>

## Create SUB Networks

1. In docker, you can create your own private networks where you can run multiple services, in this part, we will create two networks, one called bluenet and the other is rednet
2. Run the docker create network to create you networks like the ones below
```bash
## STEP 1:
## Create Networks ##
docker network create bluenet
docker network create rednet`

## STEP 2: (automatically running)
## Create (1) Container in background called "c1" running busybox image ##
docker run -itd --net bluenet --name c1 busybox sh
docker run -itd --net rednet --name c2 busybox sh
```
<img src="./webpage/subnet12.jpg" width=70%>

***Questions:***

1. Describe what is busybox and what is command switch **--name** is for? . ***(2 mark)*** __Busybox is a lightweight and versatile Unix toolkit that combines tiny versions of many common Unix utilities into a single small executable. It is often used in Docker containers as a minimalistic base image.__.

2. Explore the network using the command ```docker network ls```, show the output of your terminal. ***(1 mark)*** __name command switch: The --name switch in Docker allows you to specify a custom name for your container instead of Docker automatically generating a random name. It makes it easier to reference and manage containers using a meaningful name.__.

3. Using ```docker inspect c1``` and ```docker inspect c2``` inscpect the two network. What is the gateway of bluenet and rednet.? ***(1 mark)*** 
__Bluenet gateway: 172.18.0.1__.
__Rednet gateway: 172.19.0.1__.

4. What is the network address for the running container c1 and c2? ***(1 mark)***
__Network Address c1: 172.18.0.2__.
__Netword Address c2: 172.19.0.2__.

5. Using the command ```docker exec c1 ping c2```, which basically tries to do a ping from container c1 to c2. Are you able to ping? Show your output . ***(1 mark)***.
<img src="./webpage/subnet5.jpg" width=70%>

## Bridging two SUB Networks
1. Let's try this again by creating a network to bridge the two containers in the two subnetworks
```
docker network create bridgenet
docker network connect bridgenet c1
docker network connect bridgenet c2
docker exec c1 ping c2
```
***Questions:***

1. Are you able to ping? Show your output . ***(1 mark)*** __Yes__.
<img src="./webpage/bridge1.jpg" width=70%>

2. What is different from the previous ping in the section above? ***(1 mark)***
__the main difference is in how Docker handles network isolation and routing between containers based on whether they are in the same or different Docker networks.__.

### Node.js and MySQL in Docker Containers

This guide will help you set up a simple Node.js website that retrieves a random row from a MySQL database. Both the MySQL server and the Node.js server will run in separate Docker containers on two separate networks. Your job is to make it work by making the two containers in two separate network bridged together.

#### Step 1: Set Up the Docker Network

Create a Docker network to for the two containers.
For mysql, call it **mysqlnet** for nodejs call it **nodejsnet** .

#### Step 2: Set Up the MySQL Container

Run a MySQL container on the created network.

```sh
docker run --name mysql-container --network mysqlnet -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mydatabase -e MYSQL_USER=myuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypassword -d mysql:latest
```

#### Step 3: Set Up the Node.js Container

1. **Create a directory for your Node.js application and initialize it.**

    ```sh
    mkdir nodejs-app
    cd nodejs-app
    npm init -y
    npm install express mysql
    ```

2. **Create a file named `index.js` with the following content:**

    ```js
    const express = require('express');
    const mysql = require('mysql');

    const app = express();
    const port = 3000;

    // Create a MySQL connection
    const connection = mysql.createConnection({
      host: 'mysql-container',
      user: 'myuser',
      password: 'mypassword',
      database: 'mydatabase'
    });

    // Connect to MySQL
    connection.connect((err) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Error connecting to MySQL:', err);
        return;
      }
      console.log('Connected to MySQL');
    });

    // Define a route to get a random row
    app.get('/random', (req, res) => {
      const query = 'SELECT * FROM mytable ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1';
      connection.query(query, (err, results) => {
        if (err) {
          console.error('Error executing query:', err);
          res.status(500).send('Server Error');
          return;
        }
        res.json(results[0]);
      });
    });

    // Start the server
    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
    });
    ```

3. **Create a Dockerfile for the Node.js application:**

    ```Dockerfile
    # Use the official Node.js image
    FROM node:14

    # Create and change to the app directory
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app

    # Copy application dependency manifests to the container image
    COPY package*.json ./

    # Install production dependencies
    RUN npm install

    # Copy local code to the container image
    COPY . .

    # Run the web service on container startup
    CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
    ```

#### Step 4: Build and Run the Node.js Container

1. **Build the Docker image for the Node.js application.**

    ```sh
    docker build -t nodejs-app .
    ```

2. **Run the Node.js container on the same network as the MySQL container.**

    ```sh
    docker run --name nodejs-container --network nodejsnet -p 3000:3000 -d nodejs-app
    ```

#### Step 5: Test the Setup

You can now test the setup by accessing the Node.js application in your browser or using a tool like `curl`:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/random
```

#### Step 6: Ensure `mytable` is Populated

Make sure you have created the `mytable` table and populated it with some data in your MySQL database for the above steps to work correctly.

You can use the following SQL commands to create and populate the table (run these commands in the MySQL container):

```sql
CREATE TABLE mytable (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  value VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO mytable (name, value) VALUES ('example1', 'value1'), ('example2', 'value2'), ('example3', 'value3');
```

### Summary

You have now set up a Node.js application in a Docker container on nodejsnet netowrk and a MySQL database in another Docker container on mysqlnet network. Now bridge the two network together.

***Questions:***

1. What is the output of step 5 above, explain the error? ***(1 mark)***
__- Connection Error: Messages like "Error connecting to MySQL" or similar database connectivity issues.__
__- Query Execution Error: Errors related to executing the SQL query, such as syntax errors or issues with database permissions.__
__- Server Error: HTTP status code 500 with a message like "Server Error" indicating a problem within the server-side code.__.
<img src="./webpage/bonusq1.jpg" width=70%>

2. Show the instruction needed to make this work. ***(1 mark)***
__1. Define Route in Node.js Application:__
__Ensure that your Node.js application (index.js or similar) defines a route to handle GET requests to /random. Here's an example snippet of how to define this route using Express__
__2. Build and Run Node.js Docker Container.__
__3. Test with curl Command.__
